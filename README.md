# Week 3 - Machine Learning - Regression

This week, you’ll enter the real engine room of Artificial Intelligence — Machine Learning (ML).

You’ll learn how machines understand data, identify patterns, and make predictions — just like how humans learn from experience.

From problem identification to model creation and deployment, you’ll walk through every phase of building a working ML project

~

✅ What You’ll Learn:

 - How to identify real-world AI problems and match them to the right ML type — Supervised, Unsupervised, or Semi-Supervised
 - Difference between Classification and Regression with examples
 - Step-by-step process of creating, training, and testing ML models
 - Deep dive into Simple Linear Regression (SLR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
 - How to measure model performance using SSE, SSR, SST, R², and Adjusted R²
 - Build your first Machine Learning workflow — from Problem Identification → Model Creation → Deployment
 - Understanding training vs testing data and why both are crucial
 - Hands-on practice with simple liner , multiple linear ,Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Boosting algorithms
 - How to use GridSearchCV and Cross Validation to select the best model
 - Learn how to save, reload, and deploy models with preprocessed input/output data with hands-on assignment
 - Strengthening understanding through MCQs, exercises, and agent-based case studies

This week, you’ll step into the real world of coding with Python — the most loved and beginner-friendly programming language used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Automation.

You’ll not only learn the commands — but also understand the logic and mindset behind writing clean, smart, and powerful code.

 ✅ By the End of This Week:

 - You’ll confidently identify and solve ML problems from real scenarios
 - You’ll build, train, test, and deploy regression models on your own
 - You’ll understand how to evaluate and improve your model’s accuracy
 - You’ll be ready to apply ML logic in any domain — HR, Business, or Tech
 - You’ll complete  assignments with full clarity on workflow
 - You’ll take your first big leap — from learner to AI problem solver

✅ Week 3 Industry-Based AI Projects

 - AI in Healthcare – Insurance Charge Prediction:
   - Use AI to estimate medical insurance costs based on age, BMI & smoking habits to help insurers analyze risk and pricing.
 - AI in HR Analytics – Salary Prediction:
   - Build an AI model that predicts employee salary from experience and education, enabling data-driven hiring decisions.
  - AI in Finance – Startup Profit Prediction:
    - Use AI to forecast startup profits from spending data and optimize budget allocations for better financial planning

 ✨Next, you’ll advance into Classification Models, where machines not only predict values but also make intelligent decisions.
